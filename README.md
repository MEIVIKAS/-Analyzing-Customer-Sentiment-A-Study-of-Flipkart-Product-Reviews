# Flipkart Customer Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer sentiment towards products on Flipkart, one of Indiaâ€™s largest e-commerce platforms. By leveraging web scraping and sentiment analysis techniques, we gain valuable insights into customer opinions and satisfaction with Flipkart products.

## Methodology
The project follows the following methodology to achieve its objective:

1. **Web Scraping:** We use the BeautifulSoup library to scrape product review data from Flipkart's website. The 'scraping_review' function retrieves star ratings, review texts, and comments from multiple pages of product reviews.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:** The sentiment analysis is performed on the review texts using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library. We employ the VADER sentiment analysis tool to calculate polarity scores for each review, indicating the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

3. **Data Processing:** The scraped data and sentiment analysis results are combined to create a new DataFrame, which enables comprehensive analysis and visualization.

4. **Visualizations:** With the help of seaborn and matplotlib libraries, we create visualizations, such as bar plots and scatter plots, to present the findings effectively.

## Outcome
The project's main outcome is to provide valuable insights into customer opinions and satisfaction with Flipkart products. By understanding customer sentiment, Flipkart can make data-driven decisions to improve product offerings, customer service, and overall user experience on their platform.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:


2. **Scrape Data:** Run the 'scraping_review' function with the product page URL and the number of pages to scrape reviews.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Use the 'correlation' function to analyze the correlation between variables. Access polarity scores for each review in the 'res' dictionary.

4. **Respect Website Terms:** Please be respectful of Flipkart's terms of service while scraping data. Avoid overloading their servers and follow ethical scraping practices.
